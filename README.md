<p>The major purpose of this code is to model a system that handles cargo items with a focus on security and tamper detection. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The code uses classes and inheritance to model real-world entities (CargoItem and SecureCargoItem) and their behaviors. This helps in organizing code, promoting reuse, and enhancing maintainability.</li>
  <li>The primary focus is on ensuring that cargo items can be secured and checked for tampering. The SecureCargoItem class extends the functionality of CargoItem to include security measures and tamper detection mechanisms.</li>
  <li>The use of virtual functions (securityApproach and tamperDetection) allows for dynamic binding, where the appropriate method implementation is called based on the actual object type at runtime. This is a key feature of polymorphism in OOP.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The main function creates several SecureCargoItem objects, adds them to a list, and performs security checks and tamper detection on each item. This demonstrates how the system can manage and secure multiple cargo items in a scalable way.</p>

<h2>Security Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tamper Detection:</b> The code includes a basic form of tamper detection. While it's simplistic (detecting tampering based on whether the security code is empty), it introduces the idea of verifying the integrity of an item.</li>
  <li><b>Security Measures:</b> The securityApproach method in SecureCargoItem sets a security code based on the length of the content, representing a basic form of security measure.</li>
</ul>
